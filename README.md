# Hamming-code-calculator-7-4-
The project utilized the computer program Tinkercad to build and simulate the design. The design incorporates a Ardinuo uno microcontroller which is programmable with the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) which will be used to incorporate the design features of an LCD display, switching pins, and 7-segment displays. In coding theory, Hamming (7,4) is a linear error-correcting code that encodes four bits of data into seven bits by adding three parity bits. The project allows the user to select a 4-bit code which will be used to produce a even parity correcting code of 3-bits, resulting in a 7-bit Hamming code. The design allows the user to select a 4-bit code, which can be configured to represent a 0 or 1 by utilizing the switch pins for the appropriate 7-segment displays. Once the user has chosen the 4-bit code, the user can select the LED switch pin state witch turns on the LED and begins the process of the Hamming code calculator. The 7-bit Hamming code is computed using even parity Hamming code theory and display to the user using the LCD display.
